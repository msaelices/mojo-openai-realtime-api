# OpenAI Realtime Client in Mojo

`openai_rt_client` is a library for connecting to OpenAI's Realtime API. 

**The easiest way to get playing with the API right away** is to use the
[**Realtime Console**](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console), it uses
the reference client to deliver a fully-functional API inspector with examples
of voice visualization and more.
